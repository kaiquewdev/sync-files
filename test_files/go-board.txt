Go is played on a square board consisting of any number of crossing lines. The usual board sizes are 9x9, 13x13 or 19x19 lines, the latter being the official tournament size. To explain you the rules of the game, we will use a 7x7 board since that will be more than sufficient for this purpose. You start the game with an empty board (but see section handicap below). The dark spot in the middle of the board is used both for orientation and indication (see section handicap below).
